Well, say hello to $${\color{green}Sage}$$— short for  "**S**earch **A**n Ima**ge**". 



While it's not a wise old guru, it’s definitely a clever app that swoops in to rescue you from the chaos of forgotten images within mystery folders, and sniffs them out on your desktop faster than you can say, "Where did I save that picture again?" 🕵️
